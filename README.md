## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned in this project was how to build a hamburger menu, with small animation.

Overall this one took much longer than I had planned, but I'm happy with the progress that I made. I have found a lot of great resources to refer back to in future.

### Continued development

I need to work more on JavaScript, and handling logic. It was confusing working on the menu with modal, and even though it seems to work ok, there is definitely a lot of room for improvement!

### Useful resources

- [https://tediko.hashnode.dev/basic-animated-hamburger-menu](https://www.example.com) - This is a tutorial for animating hamburger menus written by another Frontend Mentor member.
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsUHfqw83-Q](https://www.example.com) - This YouTube video was great too - also about creating a responsive hamburger menu, using mobile-first approach.
